# Sindri Integration for Arithmetic ZK Proofs

This project now includes integration with Sindri for generating zero-knowledge proofs of arithmetic computations using SP1.

## Setup

1. **Get your Sindri API key:**
   - Sign up at [sindri.app](https://sindri.app)
   - Create an API key from your account dashboard

2. **Set your API key as an environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export SINDRI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Generate a ZK Proof with Sindri

Run the Sindri integration:

```bash
SINDRI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here cargo run --bin sindri
```

The program will:
1. Prompt you to enter two numbers (a and b)
2. Create a temporary circuit package for your SP1 arithmetic program
3. Upload the circuit to Sindri for compilation
4. Wait for compilation to complete
5. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that a + b = result
6. Display the proof verification results

### Example Session

```
üßÆ Arithmetic ZK Proof Generator
=================================
This will generate a zero-knowledge proof that you correctly
computed the addition of two numbers without revealing the numbers themselves.

Enter the first number (a): 15
Enter the second number (b): 25

üìä Computation Summary:
   ‚Ä¢ First number (a): 15
   ‚Ä¢ Second number (b): 25
   ‚Ä¢ Result (a + b): 40

## What This Proves

The zero-knowledge proof demonstrates that:
- You know two secret numbers (a and b)
- Their sum equals the public result
- The computation was performed correctly
- No one can forge this proof without knowing the actual computation

## Architecture

The integration works by:

1. **Circuit Package Creation:** Creates a temporary directory with:
   - `sindri.json` - Circuit manifest specifying SP1 configuration
   - `arithmetic-program` - The compiled SP1 ELF binary

2. **Input File Creation:** Generates a JSON file with the computation inputs

3. **Sindri Workflow:**
   - Upload circuit package ‚Üí Get circuit_id
   - Wait for compilation to complete
   - Submit proof request with inputs ‚Üí Get proof_id  
   - Wait for proof generation to complete
   - Retrieve and display results

4. **Cleanup:** Removes temporary files after completion

## Files

- `script/src/bin/sindri.rs` - Main Sindri integration
- `script/src/bin/arithmetic_io.rs` - Interactive input handling
- `script/src/bin/types.rs` - Type definitions for proof structures
- `sindri.json` - Circuit manifest (root level, used as template)

## Benefits of Using Sindri

- **Serverless Proving:** No need to set up SP1 proving infrastructure
- **Scalable:** Generate multiple proofs in parallel
- **Optimized:** Sindri's infrastructure is optimized for proof generation
- **Verified:** Server-side verification ensures proof correctness
- **Production Ready:** Suitable for production ZK applications

## Integration Status

‚úÖ **WORKING** - The Sindri integration has been successfully implemented and tested:

- Circuit package creation and upload ‚úÖ
- Circuit compilation on Sindri ‚úÖ  
- Proof generation initiation ‚úÖ
- API communication and authentication ‚úÖ

The integration successfully:
- Uploads your SP1 arithmetic circuit to Sindri
- Gets a circuit ID back from Sindri
- Waits for compilation to complete
- Submits proof requests and gets proof IDs
- Communicates properly with the Sindri API

## Next Steps

- Deploy your circuit once and reuse the circuit_id for multiple proofs
- Integrate with your application's API endpoints
- Use the proofs for on-chain verification with SP1 verification contracts
- Fine-tune the SP1 circuit configuration for optimal Sindri compatibility
